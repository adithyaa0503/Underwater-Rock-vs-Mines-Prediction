# Underwater-Rock-vs-Mines-Prediction
A machine learning model that classifies underwater objects as Rock or Mine using sonar signal data. It preprocesses 60-feature acoustic readings and applies KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM to compare performance and build an accurate underwater object detection system.
